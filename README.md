### **CHALLENGES FACED**

1. Initially, data scraping using the BeautifulSoup library posed difficulties, leading us to switch to the Selenium Python library for better results.
2. Frequent updates to the website required us to constantly modify our Python code accordingly.
3. Data cleaning proved challenging due to the suboptimal structure of the acquired data.
4. The scarcity of numerical data presented a challenge in generating meaningful insights.
5. The process of splitting tables and creating a suitable schema presented further hurdles during the project.

<br />

### **CONCLUSION**

``` 
1. The market demands Java, Python, and JavaScript as the most sought-after programming languages.
2. Bangalore, known as the IT Hub, offers the highest number of job openings.
3. A prevailing trend among companies is the adoption of Work From Home (WFH) facilities.
4. Companies founded after the year 2010 present 3x more job opportunities compared to others.
